Week 1: Core ML Concepts
Topics:

What is Machine Learning? üß†
Traditional programming vs. ML.
Learning from data: Examples and experience.
Arthur Samuel's definition (computers learning without being explicitly programmed).
Tom Mitchell's definition (Task, Performance, Experience).
Types of Machine Learning:
Supervised Learning:
Learning from labeled data (input-output pairs).
Regression: Predicting a continuous value (e.g., house price, temperature).
Classification: Predicting a categorical label (e.g., spam/not spam, cat/dog).
Unsupervised Learning:
Learning from unlabeled data to find patterns or structure.
Clustering: Grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation).
Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of variables while preserving important information (e.g., feature compression).
Association Rule Learning (briefly, e.g., market basket analysis).
Reinforcement Learning (Overview):
Learning through trial and error by interacting with an environment.
Agents, states, actions, rewards.
Examples (e.g., game playing, robotics). We won't dive deep into implementing this yet.
Common ML Terminology: üó£Ô∏è
Features (Predictors, Independent Variables): The input variables used to make a prediction.
Labels (Target, Dependent Variable): The output variable you are trying to predict (in supervised learning).
Dataset: A collection of data instances.
Training Set: Data used to train the ML model.
Test Set: Data used to evaluate the trained model's performance on unseen data.
Validation Set: (Often used) Data used to tune model hyperparameters and make decisions during training.
Model: The algorithm or mathematical representation learned from the data.
Algorithm: The specific procedure used to learn the model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree).
Overfitting: Model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen test data (memorized noise).
Underfitting: Model performs poorly on both training and test data (too simple to capture patterns).
Bias: The simplifying assumptions made by a model to make the target function easier to learn. High bias can cause underfitting.
Variance: The amount that the estimate of the target function will change if different training data is used. High variance can cause overfitting.
The Machine Learning Workflow (CRISP-DM / KDD Process - simplified): ‚öôÔ∏è
Problem Definition & Goal Setting: What are you trying to solve? What are the success metrics?
Data Collection: Gathering relevant data.
Data Preprocessing & Preparation: Cleaning, transforming, and structuring data (this is a huge part, you've touched on some aspects in Month 1).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data through statistics and visualizations (you did this last week!).
Model Selection: Choosing appropriate ML algorithms.
Model Training: Fitting the model to the training data.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance on the test/validation set.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters.
Deployment (Overview): Making the model available for use.
Monitoring & Maintenance: Tracking performance and retraining as needed.
Learning Objectives:

Clearly define machine learning and differentiate it from traditional programming.
Identify and describe the three main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
Differentiate between regression and classification tasks in supervised learning.
Explain common ML terms like features, labels, training/test sets, overfitting, and underfitting.
Outline the key steps involved in a typical machine learning workflow.
Activities & Conceptual Examples:

Read articles/watch videos explaining the difference between traditional programming and ML.

Example: Instead of writing explicit rules for a spam filter (e.g., IF email contains "viagra" THEN spam), an ML approach learns these rules from thousands of emails labeled as spam or not spam.
Find real-world examples for each type of ML:

Supervised - Regression: Predicting tomorrow's stock price based on historical data.
Supervised - Classification: Identifying if a medical image shows a tumor or not.
Unsupervised - Clustering: Grouping news articles by topic.
Reinforcement Learning: A self-driving car learning to navigate.
Discuss Overfitting/Underfitting:

Overfitting analogy: A student who memorizes answers for a specific exam but can't answer slightly different questions on the same topic.
Underfitting analogy: A student who didn't study enough and can't answer any questions well.
Map the ML Workflow steps to a hypothetical project:

Project Idea: Predicting if a customer will click on an online ad.
Problem: Increase ad click-through rate.
Data Collection: User demographics, Browse history, ad features.
Preprocessing: Handle missing values, convert text to numbers.
EDA: Visualize click patterns, feature distributions.
Model Selection: Try Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.
Training: Feed data to the chosen model.
Evaluation: Check accuracy on unseen data.
Tuning: Adjust model settings.
Deployment: Integrate model into the ad serving system.
Monitoring: Track click rates, retrain if performance drops.
