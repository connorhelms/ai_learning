Month 1: Foundations - Python, Math, and Data Handling

Week 3: Essential Math for ML - Part 1

Topics:

Linear Algebra Basics:
Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, Tensors: Definitions and representations.
Scalar: A single number.
Vector: An array of numbers (1D). Represents a point in space or a magnitude and direction.
Matrix: A 2D array of numbers. Represents linear transformations, datasets.
Tensor: A generalization to N-dimensional arrays (you've already seen 1D and 2D tensors with NumPy arrays).
Vector Operations:
Addition and Subtraction.
Scalar Multiplication.
Dot Product (Inner Product): Measures similarity/projection. Crucial in neural networks.
Vector Norm (Magnitude/Length): L1 norm, L2 norm.
Matrix Operations:
Addition and Subtraction.
Scalar Multiplication.
Matrix Multiplication (Dot Product): Different from element-wise multiplication. Key for transforming data and in neural network layers.
Transposition: Swapping rows and columns.
Identity Matrix, Inverse Matrix (conceptual understanding â€“ what they are, not necessarily how to calculate by hand for large matrices).
Introduction to Calculus (Conceptual):
Derivatives: Understanding the derivative as a rate of change or the slope of a function.
Why it's important in ML: Used in optimization algorithms (like gradient descent) to find model parameters that minimize error.
Gradients: A vector of partial derivatives for functions with multiple input variables.
Why it's important in ML: Indicates the direction of the steepest ascent of a function. Gradient descent uses the negative of the gradient to find minima.
(Focus on what they are and why they are used in ML, not on complex manual calculations of derivatives for now).
Learning Objectives:

Understand the definitions and differences between scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors.
Perform basic vector operations (addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, norm) using NumPy.
Perform basic matrix operations (addition, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, transpose) using NumPy.
Understand the concept of a derivative as a slope or rate of change.
Understand the concept of a gradient as a multi-dimensional slope.
Appreciate why derivatives and gradients are fundamental to training ML models (optimization).
