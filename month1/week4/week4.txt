Week 4: Essential Math for ML - Part 2 & Data Visualization

Topics:

Probability & Statistics Basics:
Basic Probability Concepts:
Sample space, events, probability of an event.
Conditional probability (briefly, intuitive understanding).
Independent events.
Descriptive Statistics:
Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode.
Measures of Dispersion/Variability: Variance, Standard Deviation, Range, Percentiles/Quartiles.
Probability Distributions (Conceptual Introduction):
Normal Distribution (Gaussian): Its characteristics and importance.
Binomial Distribution (briefly).
Why this is important for ML: Understanding data distributions, feature engineering, model evaluation, hypothesis testing (more advanced).
Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib:
Why visualize data? (Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA, presenting results).
Basic plots with Matplotlib:
Line plots.
Scatter plots.
Histograms.
Bar charts.
Customizing plots: Titles, labels, colors, legends.
Subplots for multiple visualizations.
Introduction to Seaborn (for enhanced statistical visualizations):
Building on Matplotlib.
Creating more aesthetically pleasing and informative statistical plots with less code.
Examples: Enhanced scatter plots, distribution plots (distplot/histplot, kdeplot), box plots, violin plots.
Learning Objectives:

Understand basic probability terms and how to calculate simple probabilities.
Calculate and interpret common descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation).
Recognize the importance and basic shape of a Normal distribution.
Create and customize basic plot types (line, scatter, histogram, bar) using Matplotlib.
Understand how to create multiple plots in one figure using subplots.
Create common statistical visualizations using Seaborn (e.g., histograms, KDE plots, box plots).
Appreciate the role of visualization in understanding data and ML results.
